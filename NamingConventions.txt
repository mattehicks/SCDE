Naming:

pointers p_
struct names   TitleCase ot Title_Case, xxx_s
typedef's      TitleCase ot Title_Case, xxx_t
struct Members  lower_case or lowerCase

Function naming:
Public functions    pfx_TitleCase (pfx = module prefix)
Private functions   TitleCase
Functions that are there, but shouldn't be called directly, or have obscure uses _TitleCase

_ underscore -> copy & paster helper prefix

Trivial variables   i,x,n,f etc...
Local variables lower_case or lowerCase
Global variables    g_lowerCase or g_lower_case (searchable by g_ prefix)

Enum        ETitleCase
Enum Members    ALL_CAPS or lowerCase

All macros and constants in caps: MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, TRACKING_ID_PREFIX.

Struct names and typedef's in camelcase: GtkWidget, TrackingOrder.
Functions that operate on structs: classic C style: gtk_widget_show(), tracking_order_process().
Pointers: nothing fancy here: GtkWidget *foo, TrackingOrder *bar.
Global variables: just don't use global variables. They are evil.
Functions that are there, but shouldn't be called directly, or have obscure uses, or whatever: one or more underscores at the beginning: _refrobnicate_data_tables(), _destroy_cache().
