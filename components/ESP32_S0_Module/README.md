ESP32_S0_Module for SCDE (Smart Connedcted Device Engine) V2

ESP32_ -> intended for use on ESP32 SoC hardware only ! 

S0 -> S0 Feature

The S0 Feature is used to analyze impulses at GPIOs (hi/lo) with the goal to count them
(S0 Power Meter, S0 Gas meter, ...). The ESP32 SoC GPIO will be connected to the Counter-Hardware.
The Counter-Hardware is used and controlled by this Module. This is hardware counting.
